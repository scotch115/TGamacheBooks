<h2>12.19.18</h2><p style="padding: 10px">I’m going to try and focus this blog on music and how I enjoy listening to it. I will also talk about what I am working at the time, so I hope you enjoy it. I will try and not to be as opinionated as my main character Nathan, but I promise nothing. I will say this. The opinions contained here are mine and you are free to agree or disagree and that is what is wonderful about art. It doesn’t mean I don’t like you if we don’t see eye to eye. It just means you’re wrong and that’s ok. (that’s me joking, in case you weren’t sure-please be prepared for so much more than that. If you are insulted, you may not want to continue…..)<br /><br />So, why a blog about music and listening? That’s a great question, glad you asked. You see, I have these philosophical discussions with my oldest son and his millennial lifestyle. His Spotifying and Netflixing and Snapchatting. Now, don’t get me wrong, I have Netflix and use Snapchat, as well as Twitter, Instagram and Facebook (my least favorite, tbh). But what I have found in both his and his friend’s lifestyle is that they are constantly multi-inputting, for lack of a better term. He watches Netflix while his phone is exploding with Snaps, that he is constantly replying to. I get stressed just having him sit next to me on the couch.<br /><br />Now, to not have this come across as a “get off my lawn” type of rant, my issue is not with how he consumes all his media at one time, I just have issue with their digestion of music in particular. This is mainly because that music flows through my blood. There is always a song going through my head. I can not listen to music while I’m doing anything else, as I get too distracted, to pay attention to what I am supposed to be working on. I am afraid that the new generation of music listeners are too passive. It is just noise in the background. In some ways, they listen to music way more than I did as it wasn’t as convenient to access at all times. With music streaming services like Apple Music (which is pretty freaking great), you basically have any artist’s complete collection at your fingertips at all times. But does this take away from some of the pure enjoyment of listening to it?<br /><br />I’ve read this on multiple other sites, but it is so true-think about the process of listening to vinyl. First you have to place the disc on the turntable and then sit and listen. Then when one side ended, you had to get up and flip it over and listen to other side. You also got the great liner notes. It was an experience. It was a process and there was some form of aesthetic to it. New vinyl has a smell, you know it if you have ever smelled it. There was also the complete focus of being in the moment. I fear that this is what is somewhat lost today. Letting yourself get lost in the music and not just have it as a constant soundtrack to their existence.<br /><br />So, I noticed that there was a rebirth of vinyl recently and my son has purchased a few of these “records” and one of his friends even has a turntable. So I enthusiastically asked, “Have you guys used the player and played these records?” But sadly, he replied that they didn’t. The records come with a digital download that they put on their phones and the records are mostly for decoration. A small part of me died.<br /><br />I get it, I’m going into the digital age kicking and screaming. I love it and hate it all at the same time. <br /><br />Maybe, I’ve just turned into one of those people who I didn’t understand when I was younger. Some dude just stuck in his era. If that’s it, I’m ok with that. I’m not going to  change the way I listen to music. I will continue to purchase my cd’s and listen to the whole record all the way through multiple times.<br /><br />So this blog will be my musical journey this year. I am deciding that I am going to spend most of my time dissecting artists and also touching base with my kids and seeing what is happening in their musical world at the same time and seeing if maybe there is some form of mutual common ground. Hopefully it will be as fun for you as it will be for me. My artist choices are theSmiths/Morrissey, Paul McCartney, or Sting. I will figure it out before the next blog post. I will also be listening to Anderson .Paak, 6lack, and Kendrick Lamar as these are my sons artists on his Spotify playlist. We’ll see how that goes…..<p>			<a class="backButton" href="javascript:history.back()">&#8249;Back</a>
